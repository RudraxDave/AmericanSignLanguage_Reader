## Introduction

This project allows you to put your abilities learned in Introduction to Deep Learning in Python and Image Processing with Pytorch in Python into practice, such as creating convolutional neural networks to categorize photos. Computer vision systems that convert sign language to spoken language have made significant development in recent years. Complex neural network topologies are frequently used in this technology to identify tiny patterns in live video. However, understanding how to construct a translation system is the first step. In this notebook, we'll learn to categorize photos of American Sign Language (ASL) letters using a convolutional neural network. We will train the network and assess its performance after loading, inspecting, and preparing the data.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model to read the American Sign Language. Building 6 CNN models and comparing performance with predefined ResNet50 model.

## Results

CNN 3 convolution layer with 89.99% accuracy
ResNet50 with 100% accuracy
